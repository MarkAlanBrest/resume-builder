Program Overview (Resume-Safe)
The Combination Welding program prepares students for entry-level welding positions with a focus on structural and pipe welding. Training emphasizes welding safety, fabrication fundamentals, and hands-on practice across multiple welding processes.

Primary Technical Training Areas
Students receive instruction and hands-on exposure in:
* Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW / Stick)
* Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW / MIG)
* Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW / TIG)
* Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)
* Structural welding applications
* Pipe welding fundamentals
* Cutting and fabrication techniques

Hands-On & Lab Experience
As part of the program, students typically participate in lab-based activities involving:
* Welding on plate and pipe using multiple processes
* Joint preparation and material fit-up
* Structural weld practice
* Pipe welding practice
* Cutting, grinding, and basic fabrication tasks
* Application of welding safety procedures and PPE
Include only experiences confirmed by the student.
