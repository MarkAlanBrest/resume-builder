* Shielded Metal Arc Welding (Stick / SMAW)
* Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)
* Structural welding applications
* Pipe welding fundamentals
* Metal fabrication techniques
* Blueprint reading and interpretation
* Cutting processes

Hands-On & Lab Experience
As part of the program, students typically participate in lab-based activities involving:
* Multi-process welding on plate and pipe
* Joint preparation, fit-up, and material handling
* Structural and pipe welding practice
* Cutting, grinding, and finishing operations
* Fabrication tasks based on basic blueprints
* Application of welding safety procedures and PPE
Include only experiences confirmed by the student.

Welding & Fabrication Skills Developed
Applicable resume skills may include:
* MIG, TIG, Stick, and FCAW welding
* Structural welding
* Pipe welding fundamentals

* Blueprint interpretation
* Welding safety practices

Tools & Equipment Exposure
Students may gain experience using common welding and fabrication equipment such as:
* MIG, TIG, and Stick welding machines
* Grinders
* Cutting torches
* Welding tables
* Clamps and fixtures
* Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Include tools only if used by the student.

Project & Lab Experience Examples
When appropriate, resumes may reference general program-based lab work such as:
* Completing multi-process welds on plate and pipe
* Fabricating metal components using blueprints
* Performing weld preparation, fit-up, and finishing
* Participating in weld testing aligned with industry standards
Projects must reflect training or participation and must not be exaggerated or fabricated.

Certifications Commonly Associated with Program
Certifications may be included only if earned and provided by the student:
* AWS or ASME welding test preparation (training only, not certification unless earned)
* Any additional student-provided certifications
No certifications may be assumed.
