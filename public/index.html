     Welcome to the New Castle School of Trades Automated Resume Builder
    </h1>

    <p>
      This tool will guide you step by step through creating a professional resume.
      Completing your resume is a required part of your program and a critical step
      in preparing for employment after graduation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your resume is often the first impression you make on an employer. A strong,
      accurate resume can open doors to interviews, while an incomplete or poorly
      prepared one can limit your opportunities. Taking the time to complete this
      process carefully is extremely important to your success.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Before you begin, please make sure you have the following information ready:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your job history, including employer names, job titles, and dates of employment</li>
      <li>Your education information, including graduation date(s)</li>
      <li>Any military service information, if applicable</li>
      <li>Any certifications, licenses, or additional training you have earned</li>
      <li>Any additional work experience, internships, or relevant hands-on experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Providing complete and accurate information will help ensure your resume reflects
      your skills, experience, and readiness for employment.
