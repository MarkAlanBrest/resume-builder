MASTER RESUME STYLE GUIDE (FULL TECHNICAL VERSION)
This guide defines all rules, logic, formatting, and content generation standards for creating student resumes across all 14 programs and campuses. All instructions in this document must be followed exactly and consistently.
SECTION 1 — GLOBAL RESUME RULES (APPLY TO ALL PROGRAMS)
1.1 Resume Purpose
Generate a clean, professional, employer ready resume tailored to the student’s program, job target, experience level, and strengths. The resume must be:
•	Clear
•	Concise
•	Accurate
•	Free of filler
•	Free of exaggeration
•	Free of assumptions
•	Free of school advertising
1.2 Required Resume Sections
Every resume must include the following sections unless logic rules specify otherwise:
1.	Contact Information
2.	Professional Summary (AI decides whether to include)
3.	Skills (always included)
4.	Work Experience (if provided)
5.	Military Experience (if applicable)
6.	Projects or Hands On Experience (AI decides based on program + student input)
7.	Education
8.	Certifications / Licenses (AI decides structure)
9.	Optional Sections (only if student provides):
o	Awards
o	Volunteer Work
o	Languages
o	Additional Skills
1.3 Formatting Rules
•	Use clean, professional formatting.
•	No icons, graphics, or decorative elements.
•	No tables.
•	No color formatting.
•	No school promotional language.
•	No references section.
•	No “References available upon request.”
•	No personal details such as age, marital status, or photo.
SECTION 2 — RESUME TYPE LOGIC
The AI must choose the resume type automatically based on the student’s background.
2.1 Resume Types
The system supports the following resume types:
A. Work Experience Resume
Use when:
•	Student has strong work history
•	Work history is relevant to job target
B. Project Based Resume
Use when:
•	Student has little or no work history
•	Student has strong hands on school projects
•	Student is switching careers
C. Hybrid Resume
Use when:
•	Student has some work history
•	Student has some projects
•	Student has mixed experience
D. Military Enhanced Hybrid
Use when:
•	Student has military experience
•	Military experience is a major strength
E. CDL Focused Resume
Use when:
•	Student is in CDL or Heavy Equipment programs
•	Student’s job target is driving or equipment operation
F. Technical Resume
Use when:
•	Student is in CNC, Electrical, HVAC, Diesel, or Electro Mechanical programs
•	Job target is highly technical
2.2 Resume Type Selection Logic
The AI must follow this logic:
•	If student has no work history → Project Based Resume
•	If student has strong work history → Work Experience Resume
•	If student has mixed experience → Hybrid Resume
•	If student has military experience → Military Enhanced Hybrid
•	If student is in CDL or Heavy Equipment → CDL Focused Resume
•	If student is in CNC, Electrical, HVAC, Diesel, Electro Mechanical → Technical Resume
SECTION 3 — TONE LOGIC
The AI must choose tone automatically.
3.1 Tone Types
•	Simple: For students with limited content
•	Professional: Default tone
•	Technical: For CNC, Electrical, HVAC, Diesel, Electro Mechanical
•	Leadership Focused: For military students
3.2 Tone Selection Logic
•	If student has military experience → Leadership Focused
•	If program is technical → Technical
•	If student has limited content → Simple
•	Otherwise → Professional
SECTION 4 — SUMMARY LOGIC
The AI decides whether to include a summary.
4.1 Include Summary When:
•	Student has enough content
•	Student has a clear job target
•	Student has strengths worth highlighting
4.2 Skip Summary When:
•	Student has extremely limited content
•	Summary would be repetitive or weak
SECTION 5 — SKILLS LOGIC
5.1 Skills Section Rules
•	Always include a Skills section
•	Always include program specific skills
•	Add student provided skills
•	Add military derived skills if applicable
•	Do not include soft skills unless they add value
SECTION 6 — GPA AND ATTENDANCE LOGIC
6.1 GPA Rules
Only include GPA if:
•	GPA is 3.0 or higher
Format:
Academic Achievement: GPA 3.4
6.2 Attendance Rules
Only include attendance if:
•	Attendance is 90% or higher
Use variation:
•	“Maintained 92% attendance”
•	“Achieved 92% attendance throughout the program”
AI must alternate between these two styles.
SECTION 7 — MILITARY EXPERIENCE RULES
If the student has military experience, include a Military Experience section.
7.1 Placement
Place after Work Experience.
7.2 Required Elements
•	Branch
•	Rank (optional)
•	Years of service

•	Armorer → Equipment manager
•	Motor Transport Operator → Commercial vehicle operator
7.4 Prohibited Content

•	Classified operations
•	Acronyms without explanation
SECTION 8 — CERTIFICATIONS & LICENSES LOGIC
8.1 Rules
•	Include school provided certifications automatically
•	Include student provided certifications
•	Include military certifications
•	CDL license gets its own section
•	If student has both licenses and certifications → separate sections
•	If student has only certifications → one section
SECTION 9 — PROJECTS / HANDS ON EXPERIENCE LOGIC
9.1 Include Projects When:
•	Student has no work history
•	Program is hands on (Welding, Building Tech, Automotive, HVAC, Electrical, CNC, Diesel)

SECTION 10 — OPTIONAL SECTIONS LOGIC
Include only if student provides:
•	Awards
•	Volunteer Work
•	Languages
•	Additional Skills
Never fabricate content.
SECTION 11 — PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES LOGIC
Include only if:
•	Student provides it
•	OR resume is too short and needs filler
•	AND program is physical (Welding, Building Tech, CDL, Heavy Equipment, Diesel, Electrical)
Use only one capability if used as filler.
SECTION 12 — CDL SPECIFIC RULES
Include driving record only if student provides it.
Examples:
•	Clean MVR
•	No major violations
Never assume.
SECTION 13 — MISSING INFORMATION RULES
If student leaves a field blank:
•	Do NOT fabricate
•	Do NOT guess
•	Do NOT invent experience
•	Do NOT add personal details
If a section is empty, skip it.
SECTION 14 — VARIATION RULES
To avoid repetitive resumes:
•	Alternate attendance phrasing
•	Vary summary structure
•	Vary bullet point openings
•	Vary soft skill placement
•	Vary project descriptions
SECTION 15 — PLACEHOLDER MAPPING
Use placeholders when student data is missing:
•	[STUDENT NAME]
•	[PHONE]
•	[EMAIL]
•	[CITY, STATE]
•	[PROGRAM NAME]
•	[EXPECTED GRADUATION DATE]
•	[CERTIFICATIONS]
•	[PROJECTS]
If a placeholder cannot be filled, remove the line.
